\textasteriskcentered{}Note: The amount to the club will be paid in a few installments.\\

\noindent
We would like to thank Dan (\texttt{K1RAU}) for acting upon the benefactors offer of a complete station, schlepping all that equipment to the CMARA Ham Flea, and doing a fine job helping one of our new members receive a complete ready to roll Ham station, at a very reasonable price. Also a big thanks to Greg (\texttt{WA1JXR}) for schlepping some donated equipment to the Ham Flea.\\

\noindent
Also thanks to Amy and Bob for collecting money and sale tickets, and all others who made the evening possible. \\

\noindent
In essence, this was the objective of the Ham Flea!

\subsection{Repeater Amplifier Failure}
The repeater committee found that the site amplifier had failed and we were running the \texttt{W1BIM} repeater on 10 watts. They have restored our regular 40 watts by swapping in another amplifier. There are still antenna issues but at least we are back to where we have been for the past 3 years. Bob Peloquin (\texttt{KB1VUA}) thinks we could replace the existing antenna with a 4 bay dipole on a side arm to increase gain and have a more omni-directional pattern.

\subsection{Field Day}
We discussed the set up at the field including the new building and where to place certain antennas. There were discussions about the food, operating modes and number of stations we could have. More to follow.

\subsection{June Meeting}
We will have final preparation discussions for Field Day.

\section{Next Month's Presentation}
Terry (\texttt{W1TR}) will present his pneumatic antenna launcher and hopefully will have some testing results to share.

\section{Meeting Adjourned}
The meeting was adjourned April 19, 2018 around 10 PM by CMARA president Bob Peloquin (\texttt{KB1VUA}).
